# dose-monitoring
Introduction
Radiation safety regulations mandate routine monitoring for healthcare workers who might receive a whole-body effective dose exceeding 1 mSv/year. This monitoring is crucial for understanding potential radiation effects, ensuring regulatory compliance, improving protection measures, and assessing dose levels to predict risks. Radiologists typically all get monitored in teaching hospitals. This study aims to evaluate potential radiation exposure among radiologists by analysing the deep dose equivalent (DDE) from chest monitors over five years and making recommendations around the utilisation of dose monitors.
Method
Dose reports from Landauerâ€™s manager portal covering January 1, 2018, to June 7, 2024, were obtained for the radiologist group. 
This Python code filter the data from July of each year to the following July. Participants are categorised based on their dose for the current year and identify staff likely to exceed 1 mSv/year and those unlikely to exceed this threshold during the study period.
